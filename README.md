# Java OOP Final Project
The banking system has 3 main products which include, a savings account, chequing account or
a credit account. The savings account is open to anyone of age while the chequing account and
credit account is for individuals above 18. Currently, customers can only have one of each
account but can make unlimited transactions without any extra fees or commission to ensure
customer satisfaction and financial stability. In addition, the system has many functionalities that
customers can utilize to have splendid baking experience.
One of the first options allows the customer to create an account in which they can have all of
the accounts if they wanted if they are above 18 and are uniquely identified by their SIN number
which is kept safe and secure from wandering burglars. In addition, the customer can later delete
his account if they felt like their experience might have been lower than expectations which is
fine since we delete all data and keep nothing in the servers. Then, the customer can sort by last
name or sin number to see all customers in the database that are present and can later search their
profile if it exists to indulge in some fun monetary transactions that can deposit money, withdraw
money, pay credit bill, process a cheque, purchase an item, transfer funds between accounts and
in conclusion allow fluidity between customer’s funds. All these transactions are also tracked by
our state of the art database and can be accessed to make sure all transactions went smoothly.
Then there is an additional explore sub-menu which allows customers to check who has the most
money and who is using their account the most and just learn fun facts about the bank system
which thousands of people use for their day to day expenses. This system was made on the idea
of withstanding a catastrophic event by maintaining financial stability within an economy so
people don’t need to worry about where their money is going and coming as we take care of that.
